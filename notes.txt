Getting involved in ROS 2 development
  yes for ROS2 for driverless
  not highest level of safety
  company of 15
  Lacking area, hard real time, security and robusness mechanisms
  Apex.OS saftey critical version of ROS2
  Hardreal time
    produce deterministis output in term of resource consumption
    all real time components, Mutexs dont block infenetly so that they can time out.
    example. Provided an alternative to the ROS2 callback. Similar to Unix style select call
    point cloud messages, as messages get larger in size so do the flight time of these messages. 
    Reduces the flight time of your large messages. 
    ROS2 Launch, intilization, can handle purturbations, being able to recovere from system level faults
    Security is a never ending battle. Not just DDS. Executable whitelist, block against malicious participants.
    over the air updates. 
    Testing and certification, how to prove code is safe. Follow functional safety standards to the letter
    hit minimal level quality and then safety
    Ros2 documentation still a bit raw. ROS2 metrics, line branch. Apex CI. Labsetup for the purpose of testing.
    Standing on the sholders of the open source comunity. Upstreaming features. 
    ROS2 is stable enough for automotive grade

RViz - The tale of a migration to ROS 2.0 - Andreas Holzner
  ROS2 Operating System Platform independent
  old code base 40k lines c++ code, 5-8 years old. almost no tests, some manual tests
  Migration steps
  Node interface with ROS, from scematic point of view, changes not that big. Account for specific differences between 
  Rviz in a nutshell. Automatically test these festures of Rvitz, integration tests. Run the display code, can cover display properties
  Conculusion, 3D rendering must be included
  rviz_visual_testing_framework
  tests easy to write and read
  take a screen shot and compare, high signal to noise ratio. Number of differnt pixels are very small.
  rviz_visual_testing_framework, making sure the tests are stable. Is migration complete, documentation for plugins and migration. 
  What is missing.

Launch for ROS 2 William Woodall (Open Robotics)
  Launch System for Ros2
  Global Paramater Server, no master that holds the parameters. Examples using new syntax, show latest and greatest.
  Example 1: Talker/Listener
    runs program that passes node names. An executable that has more than one node in it. Just want to change the name of the talked and the lisener.
    On command line, call the executable. For the lissener this argument applies. New way of doing nodelets. Load Dynamically
